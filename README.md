# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Louise has requested that I research Kickstarter campaigns to see what characterisitcs help to make a campaign successful.  She is considering a Kickstarter campaign for her play, *Fever,* with a proposed budget of $10,000. She was specifically interested in 5 recent plays from the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and asked to see information about how they were funded. Finally, she is also thinking about a future musical production in Great Britain with a potential budget of 4,000 pounds.   I have performed an analysis of data drawn from over 4,000 Kickstarter campaigns to answer the following questions:

1) What types of campaigns are likely to have successful outcomes?
2) When is the best time to launch a Kickstarter campaign?
3) How were 5 plays at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe funded?
4) What are the outcomes of campaigns for musicals in Great Britain?


## What Types of Camapigns are Likely to Have Successful Outcomes?

Firstly, the good news is that of the campaigns researched, theater campaigns are the most frequently successful.  The following table breaks down the numbers of successful and failed campaigns across some broad categories.

## When is the Best Time to Launch a Kickstarter Campaign?

Additionally, the timing of campaigns seems to be important.  The following table demonstrates that the best month for launching is May. January, June, July, and October, on the other hand,  are the months with the highest numbers of failed campaigns, with approximately the same amount of failed campaigns in each of those months.

## How Were 5 Plays at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Funded?

The plays analyzed were *Be Prepared, Checkpoint 22, Cutting Off Kate Bush, Jestia and Raedon,* and *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Family.* In this table, the goal and pledged amounts for each of the plays is shown.  The average pledge across all 5 of these plays was 38 pounds.

## What are the Outcomes of Campaigns for Musicals in Great Britain?

I used a statistical analysis of the campaigns for musicals in Great Britain to produce the chart below. The shaded areas indicate where the middle 50% of the data fall within the distributions.  The average campaign goal is around 4,000 pounds, but that value falls way outside of the actual amount pledged. The average value of total pledges is around 1,000 pounds, and the median value of total pledges is around 500 pounds, so it may be wise to lower the proposed budget for the musical.

# Recommendations

In conclusion, theater is one of the best categories for a successful Kickstarter campaign.  Consider launching your campaign in the late spring or early summer, preferably in May or June .  Finally, a modest goal is more likely to be successful than a very large goal, so try to keep your proposed budgets as low as possible.  Best of luck!
